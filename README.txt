For now, we're using the Maven project layout.

Project Structure:
src/main/java 		Application/Library sources
src/main/res	 	Application/Library resources
src/test/java 		Test sources
src/test/res 		Test resources
dep			Project dependencies
README.txt 		Project's readme

Plz follow this structure (or think of a better one).
No, we're not using MVC, that's dumb.
